# Developing Data Products Final Project

This project is for the Coursera course Packaging Data Products built off of the economics data set found in the caret package.
In general, this is a very simple project that shows my ability to create a shiny application. 

The application itself is quite simple as well. We take the economics data set and we graph the date with population and number of people unemployed.
