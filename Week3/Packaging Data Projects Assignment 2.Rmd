## Scope
This assigment does two things.

1. Completes the requirement to pass week 2 in the coursera course
2. Adds a URL that contains links to videos that I may want to visit later on.


## Interactive Map Requirement

```{r}
library(leaflet)

mwhUrl = c("<a href='https://www.mwmc.com/home'> MetroWest Hospital</a>")

my_map = leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lat=42.280721,lng=-71.335463, popup = mwhUrl)


```

## This is the actual map

```{r, echo=FALSE}
my_map
```

## This is a link to some videos that may be useful
